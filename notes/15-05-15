Genetic Algorithms
	
	Algorithms that use concepts from natural
	evolution to solve hard problems.
	
	Natural selection, mutatuion, genetic crossover
	all can be mimicked in a genetic algorithm
	
	Often used to try and solve problems with an
	enormous search space where it is close to
	impossible to try all potential solutions.
	
	General steps:
		1.	Define the problem and identify the traits
		2.	Create an encoding scheme
		3.	Generate a random population
		4.	Evaluate the fitness of each individual
		5.	"Randomly" select pairs of individuals
			to mate, giving the more fit ones a
			greater chance of being selected,
			and create a new population from the
			result of the mating.
		6.	Apply the mutation factor to the new
			population and go back to step 4.
