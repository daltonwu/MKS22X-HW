Processing
	A Java-based programming environment with an
	emphasis on graphic programming.
	
	
	Most of what you can do in Java can be done in Processing.
	
	Key differences between Processing and Java:
		No protection; everything is public
		
		Default type for floating point values is float
		
		You need to have 2 methods in your "main" file: setup() and draw()
		
		setup()
			Creates the window, sets intial properties
			
			Happens once when the program starts
		
		draw()
			Runs continuously, some number of times per second
