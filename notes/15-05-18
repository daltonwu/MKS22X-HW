Aim: How to select parents for genetic programming?


Parent Selection for Mating
	
	Selecting parents should be done randomly, but
	more fit individuals should have a better chance
	of being selected.
	
	Tournament Selection
		
		Pick 2 random members of the population,
		compare their fitness values, and select
		the one with the greater fitness value.
		
	Roulette Wheel Selection
		
		Find the sum of all the fitness values in the current population (f).
		
		Pick a random floating point number between 0 and f (r).
		
		Go through each member of the population and add their fitness values until you have a number larger than r, then select the individual you have stopped on.
