Aim: What are hash tables?

Hash Table
	An array-based structure where the location of each value in the array is found by applying a hash function to the value.

	Hash Function
		A hash function is designed to take in a value and return a unique value, called a hash code.
		
		The same input will always return the same hash code, but you cannot reverse the process to get the original value from the hash code itself.

	Hash Collisions
		
		A hash collision occurs when 2 different values have the same hash code.

		The 2 most common solutions to hash collisions are separate chaining and open addressing.
